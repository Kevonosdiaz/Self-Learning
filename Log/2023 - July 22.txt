What I did today:

- Used old alarm (physical digital clock) and I was able to wake up at ~7:15PM fairly decently

1. Exercise (Cycling)
    - Today I went to explore the Copperfield area more
    - I went past the Tim Horton's and Gas Station, and kept on the two-lane path until it merged into a single-lane path
    - There, I found "Wetland Path", which should be a nice place to run/bike and switch things up

2. Eating
    - Ate some rice, alongside a hot dog and eggs, not bad

3. Leetcode
    - Tackled Leetcode 347: Top K Frequent Elements (integers in an array, and the k top elements to return, are passed as input)
    - Initially thought it was easy, since a HashMap can be used to track the frequencies of each element, while iterating over the array
    - However, getting the top K frequent elements becomes tricky, since we want to now sort by HashMap value (frequency), but return the keys, which can be done using pairs {int,int}
    - Vectors can be used with comparator and sorting functions, but most solutions for LC347 instead use a priority queue/heap, essentially using Heapsort to track the current top element, storing it in our ans vector, and popping it off the heap to proceed with the next element

Planning on reading more Deep Work, maybe Dune, and doing some TOP
Kinda want to read CLRS on Heaps now too...
