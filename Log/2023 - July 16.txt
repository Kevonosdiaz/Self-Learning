What I did today:
1. Neetcode video -> Approach regarding:
    - Language to use: C++ or Python
    - Review old solutions
    - Max 45-60
    - Follow a study plan/roadmap -> good order to learn DS/A in
2. Learning about C++ vectors
    - #include <vector> // Make sure to use namespace std, or "using std::vector"
    - We can use the range for statement (type name : vector) to loop through all objects of <type> in our vector
    - Dynamically allocated
    - Some methods https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vector-in-cpp-stl/
3. Python
    - Setting up python (just using PyCharm to configure a virtual environment (venv) for me)
    - Relearning basic syntax and data types/variables
    - https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw
    - Quick refresher on classes & objects in python
