July 24 - July 30 Weekly Report

Work:
    Leetcode:
        - Completed 11/150 Problems on the Neetcode 150 so far
        - Near daily progress, which is good!
        - Habits are beginning to form
        - Reliant on Discussion/Solutions tabs or Neetcode video (in Python, so I still need to "translate" it at the very least), but the code I write is almost always my own, requires thinking and searching up libraries and other things for C++, and I ultimately understand most of what I've done
        - Today (Sunday), reviewed 6/11 I have done, though I will need to review a few more outside of the typical (hopefully becoming a habit) 6 review + 6 problems per week

        - Plans are to keep moving on with Two Pointers and start Sliding Window (2 or 3 problems) next week, and do another review day next Sunday

    TOP (The Odin Project):
        - Progress slowed down recently (past week or so), but I managed to keep up and do at least a bit (30min to upwards of 90min or so) almost every day
        - Managed to get through a few Flexbox portions, as well as reach the CSS/Flexbox project (Landing Page), which I've just started today
        - Expecting to need to review plenty and reference past material and other resources that have been listed in TOP, but I'm overall happy with my progress in Flexbox, and am fine with going back, since I've been able to avoid getting stuck and not progessing with this approach (Check some resources and make sure I have a decent understanding, and move on)

        - Plans are to finish the Landing Page next week, while reviewing HTML/CSS as needed during the process, and hopefully start JavaScript! May go to the Seton library to grind it out a bit

Exercise:
    - Been running, cycling, and running A LOT recently, and keeping up with occasional workout (bicep curls, squats, etc.)
    - Started doing daily Pushups + Squats + Curl-ups + 1 min Plank with Jimmy, so that's good (becoming a habit)
    - Did my daily workout prog pic and sent it to the boys, upper body and shoulder area seems to have a little bit more definition

    - Plans are to do a "running/cycling abstinence" with Jimmy beginning this Tuesday (still cycling the "right path" tomorrow), until next next monday

Books:
    - Received "The Algorithm Design Manual" (Skiena) (Began reading, 37 pages in and began 1.10 Exercises, planning to grind them at the library) and "The Pragmatic Programmer" (not planning on starting for a while)
    - Keeping up with "Deep Work", reached roughly 80% progress (200/250 pages)
    - Putting "Dune" on halt for now
    - ADM is a little bit confusing but is good so far

Misc. and Hobbies:
    - Watched Oppenheimer with Aoi/Brendon/Kaito
    - Began playing Tears of the Kingdom again
    - Started playing Mario Deluxe (Switch) with Jimmy
    - Trying out Niagara Launcher on the Pixel 7a
    - No news on Shawnessy CPL codeTeen program, but that's probably fine
    - Began eating Rice more often now

Successes and Failures:
    - (Good) Avoiding distraction has become noticably easier, and I am using Focus Mode + grayscale more often
    - (Mostly Good) Still occasional checks of Discord and stuff, but better than before
    - (Bad) Working my legs too much recently
    - (Good) Managing my time into two distinct blocks as of recently (Morning up until 3-5PM-ish is generally work/exercise time, and after is break/relax time, and the workday is over)

    - Consider spending less time on YouTube, and identifying other "time-sinks"
